This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

This challenge is to check your design, UI and UX accuracy. The Main task is to Design the Form with [Layout Method of Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/layouts), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). Of course you can use Axios in Addition.

Following are the terms that you should strictly Follow:

- There should be no UI bug in the App;
- An API **submit-form.ts** has already been made. You have to submit the form to this API Endpoints;
- Every Single Button, Input Field should be interactive, User Friendly;
- You Have to use Only Next.js and it's features. Specifically, [Layout Method of Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/layouts), [Next/Image](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image) &amp; [Next/Link](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/link);
- No extra package/library installation is allowed. You have to complete the task with existing packages.
- You can skip the Datepicker design.
- use Mock data for dropdowns. Types of data you may need:
  - Trips IDs;
  - Flowers;
  - Drinks;
  - Foods;
  - Planes;
  - Airbus;
  - Helicopters;

Please Follow the [Figma File](https://www.figma.com/file/HnzhqrsB57qOpy21MhsRwr/Front-End-Test?node-id=0%3A1&t=PvuCvdC0eReiW0NX-1) and make sure your app completely follows the design principle.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
